# Prerano

This project is experimental at this stage.

Prerano is a new programming language built on and designed to interact with PHP natively.

## About

Prerano aims to be a strongly typed language that's far less verbose than PHP, yet maintains a lot of its "charm" and all of its portability.

Right now, it's just a toy and proving ground. Over time, if it's deemed useful, it could be expanded into a production-ready system.
